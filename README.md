# GIF file resizer
Resizing GIF files is complicated. This approach simply reduces the dimentions until they are smaller then the what was given.

## Example usage:
Go to the dir where you cloned the code.  Then execute:
```./transcode.rb orig/bridge.gif resized/ 4000000```

This command will take the origial ```orig/bridge.gif``` and resize it below 4000000 bytes.  The output file will be named ```resized/bridge.gif```.
